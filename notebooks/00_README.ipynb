    "**Adult Income Dataset** (UCI Machine Learning Repository)\n",
    "- **Source**: 1994 US Census data\n",
    "- **Scale**: 32,561 records, 15 features\n",
    "- **Task**: Binary classification - predicting whether annual income exceeds $50K\n",
    "- **Feature Types**:\n",
    "  - Numerical features (6): age, education.num, hours.per.week, capital.gain/loss, fnlwgt\n",
    "  - Categorical features (9): workclass, education, marital.status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, native.country, income\n",

    "### ⚠️ Special Value of This Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is **not \"clean data\"** - it was deliberately chosen because:\n",
    "1. **Has obvious data quality issues**: Missing values marked as \"?\", outliers, duplicates\n",
    "2. **Has social biases**: 67% male gender distribution, 85% white race distribution\n",
    "3. **Has class imbalance**: High income only accounts for 24%\n",
    "4. **Has Simpson's Paradox risk**: Overall trends vs. stratified trends may be opposite\n",

    "- **Gender imbalance**: 67% Male vs 33% Female\n",
    "- **Race imbalance**: 85% White, underrepresentation of minorities\n",
    "- **Root cause**: The 1994 social structure and job market itself was unequal\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Label Bias\n",
    "- **Issue**: Income ≠ success, income ≠ ability\n",
    "- **$50K threshold**: Median in 1994, but huge cost of living differences across regions\n",
    "- **Ignores**: Non-monetary values (social contribution, job satisfaction)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Representation Bias\n",
    "- **Geographic**: Most samples from United States\n",
    "- **Occupation**: Certain occupations severely missing (e.g., emerging tech roles)\n",
    "- **Consequence**: Model reliability on minority groups is questionable\n",
